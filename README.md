# wordle-help
Wrote some python code to help me figure out wordle answers by eliminating from a list of all possible 5 letter word combinations.
<br>
Used a text file with all words and then wrote a filter to filter out all the five letter words from it.
<br>
After doing so and researching on the internet, I found out that there are text files which contain all the words which can be answers for the wordle eliminating the need for the sorter.
<br>
Finally just wrote some basic code which helps me to eliminate words from the text file based on the information I get from the wordle. Doing so eliminated words to arrive at a single word which is the answer.
